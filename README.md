# Zeta #

Custom theme designed for vgsr.nl

## Description ##

> This WordPress theme requires at least [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) 4.0 and [BuddyPress](https://buddypress.org) 2.6.

The online presence of VGSR reimagined. This second installment of VGSR WordPress themes focuses on images and readability, for all screen sizes. A large screen area is reserved to present the best of VGSR imagery, while a single white content column gives easy focus on the important message, and nothing more. It's time to shine.
