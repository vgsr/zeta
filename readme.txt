== Description ==

The online presence of VGSR reimagined. This second installment of VGSR WordPress themes focuses on images and readability, for all screen sizes. A large screen area is reserved to present the best of VGSR imagery, while a single white content column gives easy focus on the important message, and nothing more. It's time to shine.
